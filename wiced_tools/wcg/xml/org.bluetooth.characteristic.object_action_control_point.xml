        <Abstract>
            The Object Action Control Point is used by a Client to control certain behaviors of the Server. With the exception of the Create procedure which creates a new object, the OACP procedures affect the Current Object only.
        </Abstract>
        <Summary>
            The Object Action Control Point (OACP) characteristic is defined in the Object Transfer Service Section 3.3 and its sub-sections.

            <InformativeText>
                The Op Code is a mandatory field of the "Object Action Control Point" characteristic.
