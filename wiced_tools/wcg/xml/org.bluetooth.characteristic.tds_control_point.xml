    <InformativeText>
        <Abstract>
            The TDS Control Point characteristic is used to request activation of a transport. Additional Op Codes may be added in the future for other purposes.
        </Abstract>
        <Summary>
            The TDS Control Point characteristic is defined in the Transport Discovery Service, Section 4.1 and its sub-sections.
