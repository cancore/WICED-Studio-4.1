        <Abstract>
            If Object List Filter characteristics are exposed, the filter conditions shall determine which objects are included in or excluded from the list of objects. The Object List Filter characteristics can therefore modify the behavior of the Object List Control Point. The Object List Filter characteristics thus enable criteria to be set that determine which objects are exposed to the Client.
        </Abstract>
        <Summary>
            The Object List Filter characteristic is defined in the Object Transfer Service Section 3.5 and its sub-sections.
