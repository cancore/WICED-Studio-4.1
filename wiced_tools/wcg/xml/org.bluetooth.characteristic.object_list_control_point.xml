        <Abstract>
            The Object List Control Point (OLCP) characteristic is used by a Client to control certain behaviors of the Server. The role of the OLCP is to provide a mechanism for the Client to find the desired object and to designate it as the Current Object.
        </Abstract>
        <Summary>
            The Object List Control Point (OLCP) characteristic is defined in the Object Transfer Service Section 3.4 and its sub-sections.
